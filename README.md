Introduction
------------
Research and programming project to develop a tab preview product
Most popular browsers used across platforms implement a similar tab system to help users navigate between webpages. 
These systems make it difficult for user to navigate between tabs when the number of tabs is more than 10. 
In this research, we develop a new tab preview system that allows user to see a thumbnail of the tab underneath its alias. 
This new system works as an in-place linear menu that attached with the tab alias.

In the research, we compare our system with the current system, where user can only the tab alias when they open more than 10 tabs. 
As this is a new system, we conduct parametric test with one-way ANOVA and non-parametric tests with Wilcoxson Signed Rank tests. 
We found that this enhanced view has helped to significantly reduce errors when navigating between tabs and have the potential to 
fully develop as new tab preview system.
